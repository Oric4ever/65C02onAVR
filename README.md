# 65C02onAVR

This is a 65C02 virtual machine for my V-M8 microcomputer (ATmega162 with 64KB of external ram). 
It has only be tested by running two Tangerine roms: the BASIC-65 rom of the Microtan, and the Basic 1.1 of the Oric.
The emulated 65C02 runs at approximatively 2 MHz on a 16 MHz ATmega162.
I don't intend to put additional work on this virtual machine, because other virtual machines are more useful (i.e give access to a wider library of software, such as the Z80+CP/M virtual machine) or are more interesting (such as the Turbo Modula-2 Reloaded virtual machine).
